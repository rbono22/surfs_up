- Standard deviation is 3.25 in June and 3.75, which is a 0.5 difference in the two different seasons


## Summary

In conclusion, the data summarizes that a surf shop would be sustainable since the weather is warm enough in June and December with an average temperature being above 70 degrees. However, temperature should not be the only data incorporated for the final business decision. There are other attributes to the weather such as precipitation and average beach goers. With this extra data, we could run more queries to determine how we would like to build infrastructure of the shop and what areas would make this a more optimal location for visitors.
